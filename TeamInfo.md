## Project Summary
The Role Player game is an interative web-based game where users are tasked with guessing an unknown NBA player based on various stats. The game flow will have the user guess a random NBA player, and the game will output whether or not the guessed players' stats (i.e: points per game, assists per game, height, position, etc.) are less than, greater than, or very close/equal to the unknown NBA player (A color gradient will signify one of these conditions). The win condition of the game is to guess the correct NBA player.
