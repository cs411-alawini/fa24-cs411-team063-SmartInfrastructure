# NBA Player Analyzer Project Proposal

## 1. Project Title

NBA Player Analyzer

## 2. Project Summary

The NBA Player Analyzer is an interactive web application that allows users to compare any two NBA players across a wide range of statistical categories and seasons. Users can select players, choose specific stats to compare, and visualize the data through interactive charts and graphs. The tool will provide insights into player performance, career trajectories, and head-to-head comparisons to assist with fantasy basketball decisions, trade analysis, and general player evaluation.

## 3. Description

The application aims to solve the problem of quickly and easily comparing NBA players' performance across multiple statistical categories and seasons. Users will be able to:

- Select any two NBA players (current or historical)
- Choose specific statistical categories for comparison
- Select single seasons or career averages
- View side-by-side stat comparisons
- Interact with dynamic charts and graphs to visualize the data
- Access detailed player profiles and career statistics

## 4. Creative Component

The creative component will be an advanced visualization feature that generates interactive shot charts for the selected players. Users can overlay shot charts from different seasons, filter by shot type or game situation, and animate shot selection changes over a player's career. This will require integrating multiple data sources, processing complex spatial data, and creating a custom interactive visualization using D3.js or a similar library.

## 5. Usefulness

The NBA Player Analyzer will be useful for:

- Fantasy basketball players making draft or trade decisions
- Sports analysts comparing player performance
- Fans exploring player statistics and career trajectories
- Coaches and scouts evaluating player strengths and weaknesses

While there are existing NBA stats websites, this application differentiates itself by focusing on direct player comparisons with interactive visualizations and the unique shot chart overlay feature.

## 6. Realness

Data will be sourced from:

1. NBA Stats API
   - Format: JSON
   - Size: Comprehensive stats for all active players (500+) and historical players (4000+)
   - Information: Game logs, advanced stats, shot chart data

2. Kaggle NBA Database
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball
   - Format: CSV exports
   - Size: Career stats for all NBA players (4000+ rows per file)
   - Information: Players, Teams, Games, Player Stats, etc.

## 7. Functionality

Users will interact with the application through the following features:

- Player search and selection
- Stat category selection and customization
- Interactive charts and graphs (line charts, bar charts, radar charts)
- Adjustable date ranges and season selection
- Shot chart visualization with filtering options
- Player profile pages with detailed career statistics
- Ability to save comparisons and share via unique URLs
