# Guess the NBA Player Game Project Proposal

## 1. Project Title

Guess the NBA Player Game

## 2. Project Summary

The Guess the NBA Player Game is an interactive web application where users guess a NBA player based on their statistical performance. Players make educated guesses using key stats like points per game, rebounds, assists, and shooting percentages. The game provides feedback through a color-coded system, helping users refine their guesses. This engaging platform offers a unique way for basketball fans to test their knowledge of player statistics and explore the rich data of the NBA.

## 3. Description

Our project is a sports-themed guessing game where players aim to identify a mystery basketball player by making educated guesses based on key performance stats. Instead of using physical attributes like height or team division, the game will focus on statistical categories such as average points per game, average rebounds, assists, and shooting percentages. When players make a guess, the system will display a color gradient to indicate how close the guess is to the actual player’s stats—green representing closer matches, and red for guesses further away. Players use this feedback to narrow down their guesses, offering an engaging way to explore player performance metrics.

## 4. Creative Component

Taking a pre-existing game (Wordle) and integrating it with the NBA player database.
1. Developing an algorithm to compare player stats and generate color-coded feedback.
2. Creating an interactive, real-time visualization of stat comparisons.
3. Designing an adaptive hint system that analyzes user guesses and provides strategic clues based on statistical trends.

## 5. Usefulness

1. Educational Value. It helps users learn about NBA players and their statistical performances in an engaging way.
2. Entertainment. It provides a fun, daily challenge for basketball fans and trivia enthusiasts.
3. Skill Development. Regular players can improve their knowledge of NBA statistics and player comparisons.
4. Community Building. Leaderboards and shareable results create a sense of community among users.

While there are other NBA trivia games, our application is unique because it focuses on statistical comparisons and its Wordle-inspired gameplay mechanic. Unlike simple multiple-choice quizzes, our game requires analytical thinking and provides a more in-depth exploration of player performances.


## 6. Realness

Data will be sourced from:

1. NBA Stats API
   - Format: JSON
   - Size: Comprehensive stats for all active players (500+) and historical players (4000+)
   - Information: Game logs, advanced stats, shot chart data, etc.

2. Kaggle NBA Database
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball
   - Format: CSV exports
   - Size: Career stats for all NBA players (4000+ rows per file)
   - Information: Players, Teams, Games, Player Stats, etc.

## 7. Functionality

The system should feature a user-friendly interface that allows players to easily input their guesses and view feedback. It will provide real-time stat comparisons, using color gradients to indicate how close the guess is to the actual player's performance metrics. The game will track key stats like points per game, average rebounds, assists, and shooting percentages. Additionally, the system should allow for daily challenges, leaderboard tracking, and hints based on statistical trends, making it engaging for both casual players and sports enthusiasts.
