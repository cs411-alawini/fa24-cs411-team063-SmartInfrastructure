# NBA Player Analyzer Project Proposal

## 1. Project Title

NBA Player Analyzer

## 2. Description

Our project is a sports-themed guessing game where players aim to identify a mystery basketball player by making educated guesses based on key performance stats. Instead of using physical attributes like height or team division, the game will focus on statistical categories such as points per game, average rebounds, assists, and shooting percentages. When players make a guess, the system will display a color gradient to indicate how close the guess is to the actual player’s stats—green representing closer matches, and red for guesses further away. Players use this feedback to narrow down their guesses, offering an engaging way to explore player performance metrics.

## 3. Creative Component

Taking a pre-existing game and integrate it with the NBA player database. 

## 4. Realness

Data will be sourced from:

1. NBA Stats API
   - Format: JSON
   - Size: Comprehensive stats for all active players (500+) and historical players (4000+)
   - Information: Game logs, advanced stats, shot chart data

2. Kaggle NBA Database
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball
   - Format: CSV exports
   - Size: Career stats for all NBA players (4000+ rows per file)
   - Information: Players, Teams, Games, Player Stats, etc.

## 5. Functionality

The system should feature a user-friendly interface that allows players to easily input their guesses and view feedback. It will provide real-time stat comparisons, using color gradients to indicate how close the guess is to the actual player's performance metrics. The game will track key stats like points per game, average rebounds, assists, and shooting percentages. Additionally, the system should allow for daily challenges, leaderboard tracking, and hints based on statistical trends, making it engaging for both casual players and sports enthusiasts.
